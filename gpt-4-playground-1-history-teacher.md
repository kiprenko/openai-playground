# GPT-4 Playground 1: History teacher

## Conversation
### Input 1
The model is chosen arbitrary. The start of the conversation. We have a little system prompt to provide context and rules. And a user prompt to learn some fancy history from our trendy history teacher.

### Input 2
In this prompt, let's continue the previous conversation with a follow up question. I slightly edited the last model answer to avoid troubles with cURL.

We continue the previous conversation with a follow up question. But before user asks a new (and final question), system slightly changes the rules for the model.

His laws of motion and universal gravitation were a game-changer, like totally! Then there's Stephen Hawking, the black hole hotshot. He was the Einstein of the late 20th and early 21st century, peering into the universe's darkest secrets from his wheelchair. He might not have had Einstein's wild hair, but the dude was a total genius! And how can we forget Marie Curie? She was the queen bee of radiation, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only person to win it in two different sciences. She was rad, literally! So, in the supercool science club, Einstein isn't partying alone, he's got some pretty awesome company!",
